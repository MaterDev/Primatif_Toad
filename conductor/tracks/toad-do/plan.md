## Status

across multiple projects matching a query.

## Deliverables

- [~] Logic to execute shell commands in project directories.
- [ ] Integration into `bin/toad` CLI (`toad do <command> --query <str>`).
- [ ] Parallel execution support (optional/future).
- [ ] Visual feedback for batch operation results.
- [ ] Unit tests for command execution logic.
