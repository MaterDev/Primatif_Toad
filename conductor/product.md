# Product Definition: Primatif Toad

## Vision

**Primatif Toad** is a DevOps Overlay and Developer CLI designed to manage a
modular ecosystem of independent projects. It acts as a clean administrative
layer for orchestrating workspaces, discovering patterns, and providing unified
project management without polluting individual project histories.

## Core Goals

1. **Workspace Orchestration:** Manage the `projects/` directory as an external
   collection of independent repositories using a "whitelist-only" strategy.
2. **Discovery & Scaffolding:** Automate project pattern detection and component
   generation via specialized Rust crates.
3. **Unified Tooling:** Centralize quality gates and management scripts for a
   diverse set of local codebases.
4. **AI-First Design:** Maintain high-quality context metadata ("Shadows") to
   enable AI agents to assist across the entire ecosystem.

## Core Roles

- **Toad status:** Health checks across the ecosystem.
- **Toad reveal:** Deep discovery of project capabilities.
- **Toad manifest:** Context generation for AI orchestration.
- **Scaffold:** Standardized project bootstrapping.
