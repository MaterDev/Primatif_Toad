## 2026-02-04: The Great Decoupling

### Goal
Transform Primatif_Toad into a professional-grade modular platform with "AI Intuition" capabilities.

### Accomplishments
1. **Modularized Workspace:** Logic split into `toad-core` (models), `toad-discovery` (scanning), and `toad-manifest` (reporting).
2. **Context Shadow System:** Implemented `toad manifest` to generate high-density project maps in `shadows/MANIFEST.md`.
3. **Operational Intelligence:** Added Activity Tiers (Active/Cold/Archive) and VCS Health (Clean/Dirty) detection.
4. **Trust Layer:** Implemented "Lazy Fingerprinting" to detect and warn about stale context.
5. **Self-Documentation:** Added `toad docs` for programmatically accurate CLI manuals.
6. **Governance:** Established "Documentation Integrity" and "Test Separation" conventions in `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`.

### Next Steps
Ready for Phase 3: Semantic Hashtag Harvesting (Agentic/Local ML).
